      <ol>
        <li id="javascript">JavaScript (JS)</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="javascript-def">An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>
        <li id="operators">Operators</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="operators-def">A symbol that is used to perform an operation i.e +, -, *, /, %, &&.</p>
        <li id="variables">Variables</li>
        <p class ="def-hidden" id="variables-def">The purpose of a variable is to store information (values, expressions) which can be used later.</p>
        <li id="namingVars">Variable naming conventions</li>
        <p class ="def-hidden" id="variablename-def">In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>
        <li id="functions">Functions</li>
        <p class ="def-hidden" id="functions-def">Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value. In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object.</p>
        <li id="methods">Methods</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="methods-def">A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object is mostly made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods.</p>
        <li id="arguments">Arguments</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="arguments-def">JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object. The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked).</p>
        <li id="parameters">Parameters</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="parameters-def">In computer programming, a parameter is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. [a] These pieces of data are called arguments.</p>
        <li id="return">Return</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="return-def">In most programming languages, the return statement is either "return" or "return value", where value is a variable or other information coming back from the subroutine.</p>
        <li id="chainingMethods">Chaining methods</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="chainingMethods-def">AMethod chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages.</p>
        <li id="strings">Strings</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="strings-def">In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).</p>
        <li id="booleans">Booleans</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="booleans-def">In computer science, the Boolean data type is a data type, having two values (usually denoted true and false), intended to represent the truth values of logic and Boolean algebra.</p>
        <li id="undefined">Undefined</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="undefined-def">In computing (particularly, in programming), undefined value is a condition where an expression does not have a correct value, although it is syntactically correct. An undefined value must not be confused with empty string, boolean "false" or other "empty" (but defined) values.</p>
        <li id="nan">NaN</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="nan-def">In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. ... Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs.</p>
        <li id="escape">Escape</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="escape-def">If we define control characters as non-graphic, or as having a special meaning for an output device (e.g. printer or text terminal) then any escape character for this device is a control one. But escape characters used in programming (such as the backslash, "\") are graphic, hence are not control characters.</p>
        <li id="alert">Alert</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="alert-def">The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.</p>
        <li id="comments">Comments</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="comments-def">To create a single line comment in JavaScript, you place two slashes "//" in front of the code or text you wish to have the JavaScript interpreter ignore. When you place these two slashes, all text to the right of them will be ignored, until the next line.</p>
        <li id="jquery">jQuery</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="jquery-def">jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the Web.</p>

        <li id="attributes">Attributes</li>
        <p class="def-hidden" id="attributes-def">In computing, an attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata.</p>
